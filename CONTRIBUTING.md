## I Want To Contribute

- Always check for [existing issues](https://github.com/SSGorg/Navi/issues) before creating a new issue.
- Only start working on an issue if it has been assigned to you. This avoids multiple PRs for the same issue.
- Every change in this project must have an associated issue. **Issue before PR**

  ```

- Synchronize your copy before working.

  git rebase upstream/main
  ```

### Create a new branch

Creating a new branch lets you work on your issue without creating merge conflicts while making PRs.
Select a name for your branch that is in line with the issue you are addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name branch_name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made your contribution to the project, add changes to the branch you've just created:

```bash
# To add all new files to branch branch_name  
git add .  

# To add only a few files to branch_name
git add <names of files changed or added>
```

### Commit

- To commit this change, give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer

```bash
# This message will be associated with all files you have changed  
git commit -m "message"  
```

### Work Remotely

```bash
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin branch_name
```

### Pull Request

Go to your repository on your web browser and click on 'Compare and pull request'.
This will send a request to the maintainer to add your contribution to the main repository `https://github.com/SSGorg/Navi`
<br/>
Add a title to your Pull Request.
<br/>Make sure to mention which issue is solved with this Pull Request by mentioning the issue number #. Then add a description to your Pull Request that explains your contribution.
