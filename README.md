# [Navi](https://github.com/SSGOrg/Navi) Chip Market: A Navi Community Project!  

## What is the Chip Market?
Simply put its an extension of the Navi repository.   
This platform serves as a marketplace for discovering, sharing, and collaborating on innovative custom software designed to enhance the capabilities of the Navi AI Interface.   
With Navi Chips, users can personalize and tailor the AI experience to their specific needs and preferences.

## What are Chips?
Navi Chips are specialized bits of custom software, each focusing on a particular task or domain, such as but not limited to:  
- Tools
- Personalities
- Training Data

These chips act as modular components that can be seamlessly integrated into the Navi AI Interface, allowing users to extend its functionalities in various ways.

## Features
- Discover and Share: Explore a diverse collection of Navi Chips created by the community. From simple utilities to complex machine learning models, find the perfect chips to augment Navi's abilities.
- Contribute and Collaborate: Join the open-source community and contribute your own Navi Chips to the market. Collaborate with fellow developers, receive feedback, and improve your chips with collective knowledge.
- Version Control: Keep track of the evolution of Navi Chips. Version control allows users to choose the most stable and appropriate chip for their applications.
- Community Driven Ratings(Incoming): Rate and review Navi Chips based on their performance and usability. Community-driven ratings help others make informed decisions when selecting chips for their Navi AI Interface.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Navi Chip Market, follow these steps:
1. Install Navi AI Interface:
   - Before using Navi Chips, make sure you have the latest version of the Navi AI Interface installed on your device. You can find the Navi install instructions: [Here](https://github.com/SSGOrg/Navi/wiki).
3. Explore the Market:
   - Once navi is installed and running type `/chipmarket` to access the market. The rest is fairly straightforward as you will be prompted to download a chip or press enter to return to navi.
4. Once a chip is installed you will need to restart navi by typed`/stop` and then once back on your cli type `navi` again.
   - I am working out a simpler way to do this, as well as allowing for training to take place once a new training data or personality is installed.
