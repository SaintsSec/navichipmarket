These steps include: 1) Securing the scene: This involves controlling access to the area where the device is located to prevent any unauthorized changes or tampering. 2) Documenting the scene: Taking photographs and notes of the device's position, connections, and any other relevant surroundings. 3) Identifying potential evidence: Determining which devices or storage media might contain relevant information. 4) Handling the evidence: If the device is powered on, deciding whether to shut it down or to capture live memory, depending on the nature of the case and potential evidence. 5) Chain of custody: Logging every interaction with the evidence to maintain its integrity. This includes recording details like who handled it, when, why, and how."

It records who accessed the evidence, when, why, and any actions taken during its storage or analysis. Maintaining a robust chain of custody is vital to ensure that evidence has not been tampered with, altered, or otherwise compromised. A well-documented chain of custody can prove the evidence's authenticity and integrity in court, making it more likely to be accepted by a judge or jury."
